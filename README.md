# Project_e-cars
# This is a project done on Jupyter notebooks using Python as the main language.
# Gives strategies to Autolib Car hire for improvement, {version 1.0 2021}
# By Dennis Mwaniki Data Scientist.
## Description

Setup/Installation Requirements Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for data preparation and analysis. Import pandas and Numpy libraries for data manipulation. 
Also install VScode.

Involves the collection of required data and proceeds through activities for getting familiar with the data. Assessment of sources, quality and characteristics of the data are accomplished in this phase along with understanding the data and requirements. It involves the following steps: 
a) Collecting initial data – this involves getting access to the data in our case downloading our Autolib data sets.
b) Describe data - Surface properties of the collected data are examined and the results are reported. Example, value types.
c) Explore data - Exploration involves providing first insights into the data. Meaning of metadata is understood and any questions that can be addressed using querying, visualization and reporting are tackled.  Here we can see how our stations are distributed in the country.
d) Verify data quality – Confirming quality of data is consistent, making sure the data is correct, no missing values on the major cases to be handled.
